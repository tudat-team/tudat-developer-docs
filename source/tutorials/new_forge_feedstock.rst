Creating a new Forge Feedstock
==============================

.. warning:: The following has not been tested for Windows development.
    Inconsistencies **will** be present. (i.e. the directory for token
    storage)

The following extract from the `conda-feedstock`_ is a quick summary on
conda-forge and how this organisation relates to feedstocks.

.. _`conda-feedstock`: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-feedstock#:~:text=About%20conda%2Dforge,conda%20channel%20of%20installable%20packages.&text=The%20conda%2Dforge%20organization%20contains,is%20known%20as%20a%20feedstock.

    conda-forge is a community-led conda channel of installable
    packages. In order to provide high-quality builds, the process has
    been automated into the conda-forge GitHub organization.
    The conda-forge organization contains one repository for each of
    the installable packages. Such a repository is known as a feedstock.

Installation of ``conda-smithy``
--------------------------------

.. note:: It is always advised to ensure ``conda`` is up to date when dealing
          with ``conda``-related tools. ``conda update conda``

The most reliable way to install ``conda-smithy``, as only one copy of the
package should exist across all environments:


    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -n root -c conda-forge conda-smithy

Making a New Feedstock
----------------------

Creating a new feedstock will make a new package available for installation
through the conda package manager. The steps under `Making a New Feedstock`_
needs only to be carried out once in all cases. Everything else with regards to
a feedstock falls under "feedstock maintenance".

.. note:: The following guide follows the creation of a feedstock for
          ``nrlmsise-00``. This process should be adapted.

Setting up a basic recipe
*************************

Create a directory which will contain the recipe for the feedstock.

    .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir nrlmsise-00

Every ``conda-build`` recipe will generally require the three following files
to be present: 1) ``meta.yaml``, 2) ``build.sh`` and 3) ``bld.bat``.
Let's create them.

    .. code-block:: bash

        touch nrlmsise-00/meta.yaml

The ``meta.yaml`` file requires the package ``name`` and ``version`` in
order to initialise the package.

    .. code-block:: jinja

        {% set name = "NRLMSISE-00" %}
        {% set version = "0.1" %}

        package:
          name: {{ name|lower }}
          version: {{ version }}

Now there's a concept present here which isn't strictly necessary: templating
through the use of ``Jinja``. This just allows for the definition of variables
which can be reused throughout the ``yaml`` file. The effect of the above will
be the following after template rendering:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        package:
          name: nrlmsise-00
          version: 0.1

Finally, create the last two required files for the ``feedstock`` initialisation.

    .. code-block:: bash

        touch nrlmsise-00/build.sh && touch nrlmsise-00/build.sh

We can now initialise the ``nrlmsise-00-feedstock``:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda smithy init nrlmsise-00

    .. code-block:: console

        (base) ggarrett@space-station:~/tudat-space$ conda smithy init nrlmsise-00/
        No azure token. Create a token and
        put it in ~/.conda-smithy/azure.token
        No numpy version specified in conda_build_config.yaml.  Falling back to default numpy value of 1.11
        WARNING:conda_build.metadata:No numpy version specified in conda_build_config.yaml.  Falling back to default numpy value of 1.11
        Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ggarrett/tudat-space/nrlmsise-00-feedstock/.git/
        [master (root-commit) 73bf19e] Initial feedstock commit with conda-smithy 3.7.4.dev54.

         create mode 100644 recipe/build.sh
         create mode 100644 recipe/meta.yaml

        Repository created, please edit conda-forge.yml to configure the upload channels
        and afterwards call 'conda smithy register-github'
        (base) ggarrett@space-station:~/tudat-space$ ls
        nrlmsise-00  nrlmsise-00-feedstock

Success! We have initialised our first feedstock, although you can notice two
potential points of concerning ``numpy`` and the lack of an ``azure token``.
This will be both addressed.

Generating Github token
***********************

If you're familiar with retrieving a personal access token from Github, you
can skip ahead to `Setting up the Github repo`_. The following screen capture
will give you your bearings on generating the access token:
``Settings/Developer settings``.

Setting up the Github repo
**************************

.. note:: Your personal access token from Github will provide ``conda-smithy``
          with the required permissions to register a repo in your organisation,
          as long as your account has the correct permissions to the
          organisation. Save the token in the file: ``~/.conda-smithy/github.token``


.. code-block:: bash

    conda smithy register-github --organization tudat-team ./nrlmsise-00-feedstock

.. code-block:: console

    (base) ggarrett@space-station:~/tudat-space$ conda smithy register-github --organization tudat-team ./nrlmsise-00-feedstock
    No azure token. Create a token and
    put it in ~/.conda-smithy/azure.token
    No numpy version specified in conda_build_config.yaml.  Falling back to default numpy value of 1.11
    WARNING:conda_build.metadata:No numpy version specified in conda_build_config.yaml.  Falling back to default numpy value of 1.11
    Adding in variants from internal_defaults
    INFO:conda_build.variants:Adding in variants from internal_defaults
    Created tudat-team/nrlmsise-00-feedstock on github

    Repository registered at github, now call 'conda smithy register-ci'

.. code-block:: bash

    git push upstream master

Generating Azure token
**********************

Now it's time to generate our Azure token for the organisation.

1. Sign in to your organization in Azure DevOps (`https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`_)

2. From your home page, open your user settings, and then select Personal access tokens.

.. image:: graphics/select-personal-access-tokens.jpg

3. And then select + New Token.

.. image:: graphics/select-new-token.png

4. Name your token, select the organization where you want to use the token,
   and then choose a lifespan for your token.

.. image:: graphics/create-new-pat.png

5. When you're done, make sure to copy the token. For your security, it won't
   be shown again. Use this token as your password.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda smithy register-ci --organization tudat-team --feedstock_directory ./nrlmsise-00-feedstock
