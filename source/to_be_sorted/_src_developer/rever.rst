Rever: Releaser of Versions!
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Installation

       Using ``conda``:

       .. code-block:: bash

           conda install rever -c conda-forge

       Using ``pip``:

       .. code-block:: bash

           pip install re-ver

Rever is a xonsh-powered (a language hybrid between bash script and Python),
cross-platform software release tool. It automates standard activities that are
carried out during a new release. It is important to be aware of these
activities, as they are not only relevant at the moment of release.
The tasks relevant as a Tudat Developer are:

- ``authors``
- ``version_bump``
- ``changelog``
- ``tag``
- ``push_tag``
- ``bibtex``

These tasks will be elaborated upon, one-by-one in the following subsections.
Note that Rever will most likely be set up in repositories
that you encounter, therefore the explicit procedure of `Initializing Rever`_
will not be covered here, though the relevant content is covered.

.. _`Initializing Rever`: https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/index.html#initializing-rever

.. admonition:: Example

    Inside the ``developer-primer`` :cite:p:`developer-primer0.0.1` repository used in :ref:`Code Collaboration`,
    you will find files that are used to configure Rever and some that are
    autogenerated or updated when executing a release.

    The highlighted lines indicate the relevant components of the repository
    which relate to Rever configuration and activities. Grouped by their
    activity:

    +---------------+---------------------+
    | Activity      | Components          |
    +---------------+---------------------+
    | ``authors``   | - ``.authors/*``    |
    +---------------+---------------------+
    | ``bibtex``    | - ``bibtex.bib``    |
    +---------------+---------------------+
    | ``changelog`` | - ``news/*``        |
    |               | - ``CHANGELOG.rst`` |
    +---------------+---------------------+

    Finally, the ``rever.xsh`` is the configuration file for Rever.

------------

``rever.xsh``
*************

The starting point for setting up or maintaining releases versioning with Rever
is the configuration file ``rever.xsh``. As noted in the introduction, Rever
uses xonsh, which is a language hybrid between bash script and Python. There's
a good chance that if you know either of these, or both, you will feel right
at home. The following ``rever.xsh`` file is a slimmed down version of
the ``rever`` package's release configuration.

.. code-block:: bash
       :caption: basic ``rever.xsh``

       $PROJECT = 'rever'
       $ACTIVITIES = [
                     'version_bump',  # Changes the version number in various source files (setup.py, __init__.py, etc)
                     'changelog',  # Uses files in the news folder to create a changelog for release
                     'tag',  # Creates a tag for the new version number
                     'push_tag',  # Pushes the tag up to the $TAG_REMOTE
                     'pypi',  # Sends the package to pypi
                     'conda_forge',  # Creates a PR into your package's feedstock
                     'ghrelease'  # Creates a Github release entry for the new tag
                      ]

       $CHANGELOG_FILENAME = 'CHANGELOG.rst'  # Filename for the changelog
       $CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE = 'TEMPLATE.rst'  # Filename for the news template

This configuration demonstrates a basic setup for Rever. The variables
``$PROJECT`` and ``$ACTIVITIES`` are mandatory. Some activities may fail
without further variable declarations. The following sections will elaborate
sufficiently on some of the variables relevant to a Tudat Developer's workflow.

.. note::

       Rever has a well maintained, easy to read, explanation on all the
       options available for each activity in their `activities documentation`_.

.. _`activities documentation`: https://regro.github.io/rever-docs/activities.html

.. admonition:: Example

       Inside the ``developer-primer`` :cite:p:`developer-primer0.0.1`
       repository, the following configuration is used:

       .. literalinclude:: ../../tmp/developer-primer/rever.xsh
          :linenos:
          :caption: ``developer-primer/rever.xsh``
          :language: bash

------------

``version_bump``
****************

The ``version_bump`` activity will uses an environment argument
``$VERSION_BUMP_PATTERNS`` which is of the form ``List[tuple[str, str, str]]``.
These tuples defined a file path, a regular expression (regex) pattern, and a
replacement string. The regex match(es) in the specified file will be replaced
by the desired string.

.. code-block:: bash

       $VERSION_BUMP_PATTERNS = [
           ("file_path", r"regex_pattern", "replace_with"),
           ...
       ]

The use of regex is minimal and in most cases you can
use examples in existing repositories.

.. tip::
       A very polished resource for testing regex, even allowing
       for the export of code in your preferred language is
       `regular expressions 101`_.

.. _`regular expressions 101`: https://regex101.com/

.. admonition:: Example

    Inside the ``developer-primer`` :cite:p:`developer-primer0.0.1` repository used in :ref:`Code Collaboration`,
    you will find files that are used to configure Rever and some that are
    autogenerated or updated when executing a release.

    .. literalinclude:: ../../tmp/developer-primer/rever.xsh
       :caption: ``developer-primer/rever.xsh``
       :linenos:
       :language: bash
       :lineno-start: 12
       :lines: 12-16

    .. todo::
              @team, does this need further elaboration?

``authors``
***********

Manages keeping a contributors listing up-to-date. Executing
``rever <version>`` will ensure all contributors to the repository are added
to the ``AUTHORS`` file. By default, this is ordered by number of commits.
This activity will also track all contributors since the last release,
tracking all authors who contributed to the following release. These are taken
directly from git logs, and mapped to an author through the ``.authors.yaml``
file. When setting Rever up, or committing to a repository for the first time,
you may need to manually edit the ``.authors.yaml`` file. For example, if
you have committed using multiple identities, but with the same email, you
will need to set your main identity, with all others listed as ``aliases``
in the ``.authors.yaml`` file.

+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+


News Workflow
=============

One of the most helpful features of rever is the changelog activity.
This activity produces a changelog by colating news files. The changelog is
written into the repo and can be used in the GitHub release activity.

.. important:: Ensure that you have one commit prior to executing
        ``rever <MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>``, otherwise you will not appear as an
        author on the Change Log.

1. Go into the ``news/`` directory

2. Copy the ``TEMPLATE.rst`` file to another file in the ``news/`` directory. We suggest using the branchname:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cp TEMPLATE.rst branch.rst

3. The news files are customizable in the ``rever.xsh`` files. However, the default template looks like:

.. code-block:: md

    **Added:**

    * <news item>

    **Changed:**

    * <news item>

    **Deprecated:**

    * <news item>

    **Removed:**

    * <news item>

    **Fixed:**

    * <news item>

    **Security:**

    * <news item>

4. In this case you can remove the ``* <news item>`` and replace it with your own news entries, e.g.:

.. code-block:: md

    **Added:**

    * New news template tutorial

    **Changed:**

    * <news item>

    **Deprecated:**

    * <news item>

    **Removed:**

    * <news item>

    **Fixed:**

    * <news item>

    **Security:**

    * <news item>

4. Commit your ``branch.rst``.

Feel free to update this file whenever you want! Please don’t use someone
else’s file name. All of the files in this news/ directory will be merged
automatically at release time. The <news item> entries will be automatically
filtered out too!

Once the project is ready for a release when running the rever command all the
files, except the template, in the news folder will be collated and merged into
a single changelog file.

       ``developer-primer/docs/interests.yaml``, then following the news
       workflow to inform other developers. This is then concluded with
       the developer executing their first release.
