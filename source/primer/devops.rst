DevOps Primer
=============

Welcome to the DevOps Primer for the Tudat project! This guide is designed for developers and users who are new to DevOps and want to learn about the different tools and concepts involved in the development operations process.

This primer will cover the following topics:

- Environment variables
- Access tokens
- Version control (e.g. Git)
- Continuous integration and deployment

Each of these topics will be briefly introduced, with a focus on their definition, importance, and practical applications. At the end of each section, you will find links to detailed guides that cover each topic in more depth.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Environment variables are global system variables that are accessible by any process running on a system. They are used to store information such as configuration settings, file paths, and other types of data that need to be available to multiple processes.

In this primer, we will cover the basics of environment variables, including how to define and set them in different operating systems. You will learn about the different methods for setting environment variables locally and persistently, as well as how to set environment variables in Python.

For more information on environment variables, check out the `Defining Environment Variables <environment-variables.html>`_ guide.

Access Tokens
-------------

Access tokens are secure strings that are used to authenticate access to resources and services. They are often used in conjunction with API keys and other authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and systems.

In this primer, we will cover the basics of access tokens, including how to generate them for different services like Azure, GitHub, and Anaconda Cloud. You will learn about the different methods for setting environment variables for access tokens, as well as how to manage access tokens in a secure and efficient manner.

For more information on access tokens, check out the `Managing Access Tokens <access-tokens.html>`_ guide.

Version Control
---------------

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files and directories over time, so that you can easily revert to previous versions if necessary. One of the most popular version control systems is Git, which is used extensively in the Tudat project.

In this primer, we will cover the basics of version control, including an overview of Git and how it works. You will learn about the different steps involved in setting up a Git repository, making commits and pushing changes to a remote repository, and working with branches and pull requests.

For more information on version control, check out the `Code Collaboration <code-collaboration.html>`_ guide.

Continuous Integration and Deployment
-------------------------------------

Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) is a software development practice that involves automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes to production systems. This allows developers to catch bugs and other issues early in the development process, and ensures that code changes are rolled out to production systems quickly and consistently.

In this primer, we will cover the basics of CI/CD, including an overview of how it works and how to set up a CI/CD pipeline. You will learn about the different steps involved in automated testing and deployment, and how to ensure that code changes are rolled out to production systems quickly and efficiently.

For more information on continuous integration and deployment, check out the `Continuous Deployment <continuous-deployment.html>`_ guide. `working link <https://tudat-developer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/primer/devops/continuous_deployment.html#continuous-deployment>`_

Conclusion
----------

In this guide, we have covered the essential concepts and tools related to DevOps in the development process. We have explained the importance of environment variables, access tokens, version control, and continuous integration and deployment.

The use of environment variables and access tokens helps to ensure that sensitive information is stored securely, separate from the code, while version control helps manage changes to the codebase. Continuous integration and deployment streamlines the development process and reduces the risk of errors.

DevOps is a critical aspect of the software development process, and its importance cannot be overstated. By following best practices and utilizing the right tools, DevOps helps to ensure that software is delivered quickly, efficiently, and securely.

In conclusion, we recommend that developers and users new to DevOps familiarize themselves with the concepts and tools covered in this guide and take advantage of the detailed resources provided. By doing so, they will be well-equipped to make successful contributions to their projects and achieve their goals.
