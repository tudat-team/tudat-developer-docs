Below, templates to write docstrings of tudat and tudatpy objects are provided.

.. note:: It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the content of the page about :ref:`How to write docstrings`.

Enumerations
************


.. note:: This template was adapted from the docstrings of the ``RadiationPressureType`` enum (see it on `Github
    <https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-multidoc/blob/22b22740b5e5a5598ef0393f642912caf38ea2bb/docstrings/numerical_simulation/environment_setup/radiation_pressure.yaml#L28>`_),
    therefore it refers to environment settings objects. However, its content can be adapted to other base classes.

Legend:

- ``<XXX>`` = name of the enumeration
- ``<memberXName>`` = member number X of the enumeration

Base class
----------


.. note:: This template was adapted from the docstrings of the ``EphemerisSettings`` class (see it on `Github <https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-multidoc/blob/6c681130a7ad31577c9542dbc105b8d63575f0a2/docstrings/numerical_simulation/environment_setup/ephemeris.yaml#L17>`_),
    therefore it refers to environment settings objects. However, its content can be adapted to other base classes.

Legend:

- ``<XXX>`` = class name
- ``<pyattribute_1>`` = some attribute of class, which via the get/set cpp functions is exposed as a class property in
  python
- ``<pytype_1>``  = type of ``<pyattribute_1>``
- ``<description_1>`` = brief description of ``<pyattribute_1>``
- ``<pyattribute_2>`` = ...

          attributes:  # [py]  note: attributes for python only!

Derived class
---------------

.. note:: This template was adapted from the docstrings of the ``DirectSpiceEphemerisSettings`` class
    (see it on `Github <https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-multidoc/blob/6c681130a7ad31577c9542dbc105b8d63575f0a2/docstrings/numerical_simulation/environment_setup/ephemeris.yaml#L157>`_),
    therefore it refers to environment settings objects. However, its content can be adapted to other derived classes.

Legend:

- ``<XXY>`` = DirectSpiceEphemeris
- ``<XXX>`` = Ephemeris
- ``<xxy>`` = directSpiceEphemerisSettings (factory function)

.. note:: Public attributes & methods from the ``<XXX>`` base class do not have to be re-documented in derived classes
    (they are inherited in the API).

.. toggle-header::
    :header: **Show template**

    .. code-block:: yaml

          short_summary: "Class for defining settings of <XXY>."
          extended_summary: "`<XXX>Settings` derived class for ephemeris which <minimal description of derived class>."

           attributes:
             # same scheme as documenting attributes from base class: python only, distinction read/write

            methods:  python constructor docstrings no longer needed, since constructor will be removed from exposure.
              - name: ctor # [cpp]
                short_summary: "Constructor." # [cpp]

Functions
*********

.. note:: This template was adapted from the docstrings of the ``directSpiceEphemerisSettings`` factory function
    (see it on `Github <https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-multidoc/blob/6c681130a7ad31577c9542dbc105b8d63575f0a2/docstrings/numerical_simulation/environment_setup/ephemeris.yaml#L459>`_),
    therefore it refers to environment settings objects. However, its content can be adapted to other functions.

              < additional info / context, mostly found on tudat-space/API/... website >
              This function creates an instance of an `<XXX>Settings` derived `<XXY>Settings` object.
